# Personal Tech Blog
This repository hosts the code for my personal tech blog at [chrisgroleau.com](chrisgroleau.com)

This site is built with Hugo and the Goa theme, and deployed with Cloudflare Pages.

Yes, I could, and I have built Next.js blogs deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. This project isn't to learn any new frameworks or tools this time, it's actually just about the content. So we're keeping it dead simple.
