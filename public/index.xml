      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;fail-fast-fail-forward&#34;&gt;Fail Fast, Fail Forward&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a ubiquitous mantra in modern software development. Why does it capture so much attention? Say anything that flips conventional thought on it&amp;rsquo;s head and it&amp;rsquo;s bound to make people stop and think. You mean failure can actually be good?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course the reality is quite a bit more nuanced than that. Obviously you can&amp;rsquo;t go writing bad code directly on the production server in the name of developer velocity and expect it to go well. &lt;em&gt;Fail Fast, Fail Forward&lt;/em&gt; only works when solid DevOps practices are in place to greatly reduce the impact of and improve time to recovery for failures. And let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that &amp;ldquo;failing forward&amp;rdquo; is meant to remind us that processes should also be in place to ensure that failures always result in improvement. Ideally the same failure should never happen twice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Software Engineering runs in my family. My dad was a Sonarman in the Navy in the 70s and 80s when computers were beginning to be installed on Navy ships. As an avid reader and lifelong learner, my dad knew quite a bit about a lot of things, so when the sailors who were meant to work on the computers didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to troubleshoot the new equipment, dad stepped in and was able to quickly learn how the computer worked based on his experience in other electronic systems. As a reward of a job well done, dad&amp;rsquo;s commanding officer then asked him to write the manual for the device.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
