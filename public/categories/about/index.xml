      <description>&lt;p&gt;Software Engineering runs in my family. My dad was a Sonarman in the Navy in the 70s and 80s when computers were beginning to be installed on Navy ships. As an avid reader and lifelong learner, my dad knew quite a bit about a lot of things, so when the sailors who were meant to work on the computers didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to troubleshoot the new equipment, dad stepped in and was able to quickly learn how the computer worked based on his experience in other electronic systems. As a reward of a job well done, dad&amp;rsquo;s commanding officer then asked him to write the manual for the device.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
